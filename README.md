# üåê Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code and infrastructure configuration for my personal portfolio website.  
The application is designed to showcase **projects, skills, and professional experience**, while also serving as a practical demonstration of **modern DevOps and cloud practices**.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

The portfolio website is built with **Django** and runs on **PostgreSQL** as the primary database.  
The entire application is **containerized with Docker and Docker Compose**, allowing it to be easily replicated and deployed locally or in the cloud.

For production, the project is deployed on **AWS** using **Terraform** as Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  
A **CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions** ensures continuous delivery, automatically building, testing, and deploying the application whenever changes are pushed.

The cloud infrastructure is composed of several AWS services working together:

- **EC2** ‚Üí Virtual machine hosting the Django application in containers.  
- **RDS (PostgreSQL)** ‚Üí Managed relational database for storing project, skill, and experience data.  
- **S3** ‚Üí Storage for static and media files.  
- **CloudFront** ‚Üí Global CDN and entry point for the website and assets.  
- **Route 53** ‚Üí DNS management to route traffic to the application.  

This setup highlights the integration of **Python/Django development** with **DevOps practices**, **cloud services**, and **infrastructure automation**.
